      <h2>I Lost My 5-Year Job Today</h2>
      <h5>By A.H.</h5>
      <h5>June 19, 2021</h5>
    When my city went to lockdown, I was not able to keep my job. I tried finding a new job but with no avail.There's even a study that proves Asian Americans are the top working group to be the most affected by COVID. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543758/">Source</a><br> <br>Fortunately, I stumbled abut CS LAP where I found a job that could let me speak my first language (Chinese). So thank you CS LAP for offering me hope and now I'm not jobless anymore! For those who haven't tried CS LAP, I strongly recommend it because you can find open jobs easily. <br>

      <h2>Apparently I Was Not The Right Minority For A Job</h2>
      <h5>By L.K.</h5>
      <h5>June 19, 2021</h5>
      <p>Two weeks ago, I was interviewed for a PM (Project Manager) role. Resume-wise, I was pretty confident about my accomplishments. I have an experience of eight years as a PM, but I was not prepared for my interviewer's comment. At the end of the interview, my interviewer said that I was "not the right minority" for the job. I am Korean. I am a minority. When was there a minority group that's right, and a minority group that's wrong? I asked my interviewer what he meant by the "right minority." He replied that they are not looking for Asians since he doesn't think of them as a minority. I left the room speechless.<br><br>Later that day, I stumbled upon a news article similar to my experience. An ex-NFL assistant coach was denied a job because the company doesn't think he is the right minority for their image. I'll add the link to his story <a href ="https://nextshark.com/ex-nfl-assistant-coach-not-the-right-minority-job-interview/">here.</a> <br><br> Has anyone ever had this interview experience before?

      <h2>Racist Remarks Since COVID-19</h2>
      <h5>By J.M.</h5>
      <h5>June 18, 2021</h5>
      <p>Hello everyone. Times are tough. I wanted to post about my feelings these days. I have not been feeling at ease in my surroundings because I've been reading a lot of news concerning verbal and physical attacks against Asians. I have been carrying a pepper spray on me whenever I go to work, which I shouldn't be doing in the first place. My friend has been called racial slurs in the train. I've recently heard news of a family that received a racist letter. Heartbreaking. I just don't know how to keep the community from these attacks. But I hope everyone is safe.</p>
