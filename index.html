	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<p>Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic have been impacted in multiple aspects in terms of financial and educational opportunities. CS LAP stands for "Creating Successful Lives for Asian People." This is a way to come together and support each other in the Asian community. We know that many individuals have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and might be trying to find another one right now. With CS LAP, we hope to minimize the impact the pandemic has caused by offering a job search service. Based on your preferred language and location, you can find available jobs nearby. If you have children or wanting to take care of children while their parents are busy, there is a babysitter search service. If you want to discuss the recent events with the Asian community, simply post in the blog. </p>

	<h1>How to Navigate CS LAP</h1>
	<p>In the Jobs tab, there will be options for each question to choose from. Select which occupation you're applying for, your first and/or second languages (s), and location. When you click the "Find jobs" button, a map of available jobs will appear. The same concept applies for the day cares. In the blog, you can view others' posts and comment replies. You can also make a post to share the experiences you have faced during the pandemic or resources that can help the Asian community. </p>
